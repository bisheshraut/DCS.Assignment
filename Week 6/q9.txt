In this code 
for the  loops :
First loop :for(i=0; i<n; i++)
Second nested loop :for(j=0; j<=i; j++)
The first loop runs n times which means it has the time complexity O(n).
The nested loop runs up to the value of i.
This means that when the total operation runs it creates the series 1,2,3,..,n.
We can express this in the form of n(n+1)/2 =n^2+n/2.
The dominant term is n^2.
So, the time complexity of the algorithm is O(n^2).
