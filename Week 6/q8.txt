In this code 
for the first three loops :
for(i=0; i<n; i++) 
     for(j=0; j<n; j++)
       for(k=0; k<n; k++) 
All the loop runs n times O(n).Which means the time complexity of the triple loop is O(n^3)

Now for the second part:
first loop : for(i=0; i<n; i++)
second loop : for(j=10; j>=1; j--)
The first loop runs n times which means its time complexity is O(n).
The second loop runs 10 times which is constant so its time complexity is O(10).
As 0(10) is ignored the final time complexity becomes O(n) for this part.
Now,
Final time complexity = O(n^3)+O(n)
Here the most dominant term is n^3.
So the final time complexity of the algorithm is O(n^3).
